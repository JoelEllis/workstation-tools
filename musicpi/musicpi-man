.SH "NOTE"
Since MPD uses UTF\-8, mpc needs to convert characters to the charset used by the local system. If you get character conversion errors when you're running mpc you probably need to set up your locale. This is done by setting any of the LC_CTYPE, LANG or LC_ALL environment variables (LC_CTYPE only affects character handling).
